# Network-Configuration-Simulation-Lab-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
This lab was completed using Cisco Packet Tracer to design and simulate a functional small network. The lab focused on inter-router connectivity and the configuration of essential network services, providing hands-on experience with real-world network setups.


Key Tasks Performed:
Created a network topology with two routers, switches, and multiple end devices

Configured routing between the two routers for full network connectivity

Set up and tested a DHCP server to assign IP addresses dynamically

Configured a DNS server to resolve domain names

Deployed and tested a web server to simulate internal hosting

Verified connectivity using ping, traceroute, and web browser simulation

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies:
Cisco Packet Tracer

Static Routing / Dynamic Routing 

DHCP, DNS, and HTTP configurations

Cisco CLI for router and switch setup
